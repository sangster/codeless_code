=================

This repository contains all the content of [The Codeless Code](http://www.thecodelesscode.com) 
(i.e. the translations and the original cases by Qi), an inspiring and beautiful 
collection of “fables and kōans for the software engineer”.

Adding a translation
--------------------

If you want to add your translation:

  1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/alessandro1997/the-codeless-code/fork).
  2. Create a directory named after your language code and translator name (e.g. **en-qi**).
  3. Add a branch for the case(s) you want to translate (e.g. **case-42** or **cases-1-10**).
  4. Add your translations.
  5. Push the changes.
  6. File a [Pull Request](https://github.com/alessandro1997/the-codeless-code/pulls).

Translation format
------------------

You can find information about the format to follow [here](http://thecodelesscode.com/about#submitting-translations).

Only keep the `Number` header, translate the `Title`, and possibly
`Tagline` and `Illus.X.title` for the images' `alt` tags.
Add `Lang` with the locale and `Translator` with your translator nickname.
All other headers will be ignored and taken from the original English version.

Many thanks to Qi for this ingenious work of art and to all the translators for
their hard work.
